here in this folder we are making a irrigation model that is
going to respond according to the soil moisture and will act accordingly
for example
if soil moisture is less than 50 it will triger fast irrigation

to run this
cd over to irrigation
python reinforcement.py

this was our model
we have a data.py file that is to generate random data of soil moisture between 10 to 90
in data.csv file

now we have three files left 2d.py , 3d.py , 3da.py

python 2d.py file will make a 2d visualization of the model

python 3d.py will make a 3d visulization of teh model with respectt to plant growth over 70 day
python 3da.py will make a animated 3d version over the 70 days of the farming.
