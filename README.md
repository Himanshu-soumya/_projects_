NPK Sensor-Based Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System
Overview
This project involves using an NPK sensor to measure the levels of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in the soil. The measured NPK values are then used to predict the most suitable crops and recommend the appropriate fertilizers for optimal soil health and yield. The goal is to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions to improve agricultural productivity.

Project Workflow
Data Collection:

Use the NPK sensor to measure the nutrient levels in the soil.
The sensor collects data on Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium concentrations, which are critical for crop growth.
Data Processing:

The collected NPK values are processed and fed into a machine learning model or decision-making system.
The system analyzes the data to understand the soilâ€™s nutrient profile.
Prediction:

Based on the NPK values, the system predicts the most suitable crops that can be grown in the given soil conditions.
The system also recommends the best fertilizers to balance the soil nutrients and enhance crop growth.
Recommendations:

Display the recommended crops and fertilizers to the user.
Provide guidelines on the quantities of fertilizers to use for optimal soil health.
